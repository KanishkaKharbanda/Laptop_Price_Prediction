The **Laptop Price Prediction Project** on Streamlit is designed to predict laptop prices based on various features by leveraging machine learning models. The project involves a comprehensive workflow starting with data cleaning to handle inconsistencies and prepare the dataset for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights in the data.

Multiple machine learning algorithms are tested, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, Voting Regressor, and Stacking, to determine the most accurate model. Among these, Random Forest emerged as the best-performing algorithm for predicting laptop prices.

Finally, an `app.py` script is developed to deploy the model on a Streamlit web app, enabling users to input specifications and obtain price predictions in real-time.

### Advantages:
1. **Real-Time Predictions:** Users can input specifications and get immediate price predictions, making it highly interactive.
2. **Comprehensive Model Comparison:** Testing a wide range of algorithms ensures the selection of the most accurate model.
3. **Ease of Access:** Deploying on Streamlit makes the app accessible from any device with internet access.
4. **Data-Driven Insights:** EDA provides valuable insights into the factors that influence laptop prices, aiding both users and manufacturers in decision-making.
5. **Scalable and Customizable:** The project can easily be scaled or customized to include more features or to predict prices for other electronics.
